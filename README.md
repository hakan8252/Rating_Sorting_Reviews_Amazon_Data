# Rating_Sorting_Reviews_Amazon_Data

One of the most important problems in e-commerce is the correct calculation of the points given to the products after the sale. The solution to this problem is providing more customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, making the product stand out for the sellers and a seamless shopping experience for the buyers. Another problem is the correct ordering of the comments given to the products. Since misleading comments will directly affect the sale of the product, it will cause both material loss and loss of customers. When these 2 main problems are solved, e-commerce site and sellers will increase their sales, while their customers will complete the purchasing journey without any problems.
